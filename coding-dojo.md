# What is a Coding Dojo?

> A Coding Dojo is a meeting where a bunch of coders get together to work on a programming challenge. They are there to have fun and to engage in Deliberate Practice in order to improve their skills.

## Goals:

- Improve your knowledge in a language / framework
- Pick up a new programming language / framework
- Inculcate developer practices (TDD, BDD, pair-programming)

## What is a Code Kata?

> A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each.

- You need to try it as many times as it takes, and be comfortable making mistakes.
- You need to look for feedback each time so you can work to improve. 
- Remember that the point of the kata is not arriving at a correct answer. The point is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the solution.
