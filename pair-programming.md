# Pair Programming

## What is Pair-Programming?

- An agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation (1 computer, 2 sets of keyboard & mouse, 2 monitors).
- Roles:
    - **Driver** - writes code 
    - **Observer / Navigator** - reviews each line of code as it is typed in.
- The two programmers switch roles frequently.

## Practical Tips

- **Be conversational.** Talk through your thought process. Because people can't read minds.
- **Plan.** Take time to plan what you hope to achieve at the beginning of the pairing session.
- **Take notes.** I find that sometimes, it's faster to communicate ideas on paper/whiteboard than on the screen. I draw architectural diagrams and bullet points on paper (or on a whiteboard) to brainstorm ideas.
- Agree on a pairing workflow. There are many pairing technique. My favourite is the Ping-Pong method - where one pair writes a test, and the other pair writes the code that passes the test, and repeat.
- **Focus on the work at hand.** Don't get distracted by non-work PM, emails and social media pings. Don't waste the other pair's time.
- **Share keyboard time.** Don't hog the keyboard. Let the other pair speak through code as well. Be patient with them.
- **Use on screen cues** to help bring focus. Use line number to help zoom in on code. Learn to bring focus to things on screen with the mouse cursor instead of your finger. 
- **Take breaks.** Do take breaks frequently. Once you reach a natural breakpoint, like after a Git check commit has been made, do take a short break to clear the mind. Pairing can be very intense and involves much concentration and focus - so taking frequent breaks will help rest your mind.
