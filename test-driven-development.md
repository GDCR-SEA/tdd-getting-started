## TDD Rules

1. **Start with a test:** only start writing production code when your automated test has failed.
2. **Baby steps:** Only 1 failing test at a time.
3. **Baby tests:** Write small test.
4. Write enough production code to make the failing test pass. No extra code.
5. **Baby steps:** Implement simplest algorithm first, then generate it later when you identify some patterns.
6. Don’t forget about refactoring.
7. Refactor your tests too!
8. Don’t refactor when your tests are failing. Make tests pass first.
